## General Prompting Techniques 


* Guidelines for Prompting

    * Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
    * Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”


        * Principle 1 :- 

            *  Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
            * Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

            * Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

            * Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting

        * Principle 2 :- 

            * Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task

            * Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

* Summarizing

    * Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit

* Inferring

    * Sentiment (positive/negative)

    * Identify types of emotions

    * Identify anger

    * Inferring topics .. all topics at once in a loop


* Transforming

    * Transforming - Translation

* Chat Bot 

    * Pizza Chat Bot - and returns a desired output in JSON format 

## Amazon bedrock prompting 

In these notebooks, we include different example use cases for Travel & Hospitality using Amazon Bedrock.

These sample use cases involve different tasks and prompt engeering techniques, as follows:

Generate recommendations based on metadata

* Task: Text Generation
* Prompt Technique: Zero-shot

Estimate capacity for airlines or hotel properties based on historical data

* Task: Complex Reasoning
* Prompt Technique: Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT)
Create a question answering assistant for customer service

* Task: Question Answering with Dialogue Asistant (without memory)
* Prompt Technique: Few-shot
Summarize and classify content from media files transcription

* Task: Text Summarization & Text Classification
* Prompt Technique: Zero-shot
Create splash pages describing upcoming promotions

* Task: Code Generation
* Prompt Technique: Zero-shot
